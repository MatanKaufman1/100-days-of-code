# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

## This is a fun turtle race simulation built using Python's turtle module.
        The user bets on a turtle color before the race begins, and the turtles move randomly toward the finish line.
        If the chosen turtle wins, the user wins!
        🎮 How It Works:

    The game displays six turtles in different colors:
    Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Orange, and Purple.
    The user places a bet by entering a turtle color.
    The turtles start racing with random movements.
    The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
    The program checks if the user's bet matches the winner and prints the result.

📌 Features:

✔️ User can place a bet before the race.
✔️ Turtles move randomly, making the race unpredictable.
✔️ The game displays the winning turtle's color.
